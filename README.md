# Business Forecasting with Python

## Overview
In this project, I examined 16 annoynmized properties for a major hotel chain. The goal was to identify how to best forecast the 4-weeks ahead occupancy rate for each property based on:   
  1. Historical demand;
  2. attributes (property type, etc);
  3. Available on-the-book data; and
  4. Any exogenous features I can extract.

 For my analysis, I examined five categories of forecasting models:  
   1. **Simple baselines**, which included the Naive and SeasonalNaive; 
   1. **Error trend seasonality**, where I examined the use of `AutoETS`;
   1. **Statistical models**, `AutoARIMA`;
   1. **Machine Learning models**, `LightGBM`;
   1. **Deep Learning models**,  ; 
   1. **Transformer models**, `TimeGPT`.

## Python Notebook
The Python Notebook containing my code, results, and insights is available at: [Python Hotel Forecasting Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HKo7VRzrUcmY0nbYEUL9FPqgOe9dcTdu?usp=sharing).

## Business Insights

TBD.
